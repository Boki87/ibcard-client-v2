        Once you have ordered your premium card, check your email address to
        which you received the address to upload your logo. We will download
        your logo and create your card design. You will then approve the design
        before printing for overall satisfaction. Your order has been completed.

        2. How does NFC technology work?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        i-b card cards have an NFC chip that sends your data completely securely
        wirelessly. If you tap the card on compatible phones, a link to your
        contact information will open, and everything is ready to save to your
        phone.

      </h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        On your home screen, after touching your i-b card, there is a login

      </p>

      <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-bold">
        4. Do I need to download an application to use the card.
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        No. Simply tap the phone with the card and you're ready to go.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-bold">
        5. Which phones are compatible with NFC technology?

        6. Can I order a card designed for my company?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Surely. After ordering premium cards, they will receive an e-mail link
        to access the administration system. There you can enter information
        about your company and employees. You will also be able to send your
        company logo here (ai, pdf - required)

        7. What about i-b card card security?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        i-b card is absolutely secure because all data is on a secure server.
        Data is not stored on the card itself. It only works within one inch of
        a compatible device and can only share, not extract, information. In
        addition, there is no stored financial information. All shared details
        are usually details you will have on any of your traditional business
        cards.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-bold">
        8. Is there a monthly subscription?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Once you order your card, it is yours without a subscription. A portal
        for connecting companies is being developed, which will have a monthly
        subscription depending on the services that the company will use.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-bold">
        9. Can I connect with a digital business card to colleagues from another
        company who use an i-b card?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Surely. A portal for companies is under construction, where it will be
        possible to connect contacts in different ways
      </p>

      <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-bold">
        10. Can I have multiple profiles on the card?
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-6">
        That. If you want to use more than one card, use the same e-mail address
        to register on the new card. You can store up to three profiles once you
        purchase a card.
      </p>

      <h3 className="mb-2 text-lg font-bold">
